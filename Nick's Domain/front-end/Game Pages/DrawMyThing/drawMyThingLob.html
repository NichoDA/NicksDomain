    <h1 class="title">Draw My Thing</h1>
    <p>In this game-mode, one player must select a prompt to draw, while the other players have to guess what they are drawing. 
      The drawer gets points each time someone correctly guesses their prompt, and the guessers get more points the faster they guess. 
      The host can choose how many rounds there are, and each round a new person draws.</p>
